# Grading

Your grade for the course will be determined by the points you earn on items
in the following categories.

- **Exams** (30%): There will be three exams in the course, including the final exam. Dates for the first two exams will be set and announced at least one week in advance. All three exams will be administered online using Canvas and the Honorlock proctoring system.

- **Programming Tests** (30%): There will be three programming-based tests in the course. Dates for each will be set and announced at least one week in advance. All three tests will be administered online using Canvas and the Honorlock proctoring system. Programming Test grades will be based on the percentage of test cases passed. Passing zero test cases will result in a grade of zero points.

- **Programming Assignments** (20%): There will be a series of programming assignments that require you to implement a solution to a problem using MATLAB. Grades for these assignments will be based on the percentage of test cases passed. Passing zero test cases will result in a grade of zero points.

- **zyBook Participation Activities** (5%): There will be a series of Participation Activities throughout the assigned chapters of the course zyBook. You will complete these activities directly in the zyBook and submit them to earn points for your work.

- **zyBook Challenge Activities** (15%): There will be a series of Challenge Activities throughout the assigned chapters of the course zyBook. You will complete these activities directly in the zyBook and submit them to earn points for your work.

Your total score (*Total*) for the course will be calculated as follows, where
*E* is the percentage of possible points earned on exams, *T* is the
percentage of possible points earned on programming tests, *A* is the
percentage of possible points earned on programming assignments, *Zp* is the percentage of possible points earned on zyBook participation activities
and *Zc* is the percentage of possible points earned on zyBook challenge activities. Each percentage
is calculated as (*points earned* / *points possible*) * 100.


*Total* = (0.3 * *E*) + (0.3 * *T*) + (0.2 * *A*) + (0.05 * *Zp*) + (0.15 * *Zc*)

Your letter grade for the course will be assigned based on your *Total*
numeric score using the following scale.

*Total*   | Letter Grade
--------  | ------------
[90, 100] | A
[80, 90)  | B
[70, 80)  | C
[60, 70)  | D
[0, 60)   | F

**Grades will NOT be rounded up at semester end.**

**Extra Credit:** Opportunities for extra credit are sometimes given to the
entire class, but are never given on an individual basis.

# Course Policies


## Attendance

The 
[AU Policy on Class Attendance](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/PolicyonClassAttendance.pdf) 
is strictly observed in this course. Refer to the Instructional Mode section of
this syllabus for a description of all course elements that require attendance.
Absences are considered unexcused unless the student specifically obtains an
excused absence from the instructor (see policy below).

Note that *attendance* is only one part of *engagement*. You are expected to
fully engage in this course and take responsibility for your learning
experience. Lack of engagement almost always leads to poor course performance.

## Face Coverings - Fall 2021

The university permits individual faculty members to require face coverings in their classrooms and instructional laboratories.
All students enrolled in this course are required to properly wear a face covering that covers the nose and mouth while inside 
the classroom, laboratory, studio, or office. Failure to comply with this requirement represents a potential Code of Student 
Conduct violation and may be reported as a non-academic violation. 
Please consult the [Classroom Behavior Policy](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/PolicyonClassroomBehavior.pdf) for additional details.

## Excused Absences

To have an absence excused you must first obtain an Excused Absence Memo from
Engineering Student Services (ESS), as described below.

> Engineering Student Services provides excused absence memos to students who
> present verifiable documentation related to university excused absences.  The
> steps for obtaining an excused absence memo are as follows:
>
> 1. The student submits the request form using this link: [https://aub.ie/EngAbsence](https://aub.ie/EngAbsence)
>    - Students submit documentation of the reason for the absence.
>    - Students must read and acknowledge the excused absence policy.
>
> 1. The ESS office staff processes the requests and verifies authenticity of documentation provided by student, as well as the dates of the absence(s).
>
> 1. Assistant Dean determines if the documentation meets the standard for a university excused absence or if the documentation warrants consideration by the professor.
>
> 1. An official memo is sent directly to professors via email regarding the student’s absence
>
> NOTE: The ESS office does not process excused absences for red screens from the
> GuideSafe app. Students receive a notification email related to the “greater
> risk” red screen instructing them not to come to campus.  Students can provide
> this email as documentation for Covid-related absences. 


## Exam and Test Makeup

A missed exam or test can only be made up for excused absences (see policy).
Students must contact the instructor **within 48 hours** from the time that the
exam or test was given or the exam or test score will remain zero. The makeup
schedule is determined by the instructor and will need to be done within five
business days from the time that the exam or test was given.  


## Late Assignment Submission

All assignments are due no later than the date and time specified in Canvas, and
no late submissions are accepted. If you believe that your situation warrants an
exception to this policy (e.g., medical emergency) you must treat this as an
*absence* and have the absence excused (see policy).


## Connectivity Issues

If connectivity issues (e.g., Internet connection problems, electrical power
failures) prevent you from completing an element of the course on time, you must
notify the instructor immediately when the incident occurs (email to
`hzk0070@auburn.edu` and/or voicemail to 334-844-6310) and then provide appropriate
documentation (e.g., service provider notices) within one hour of the incident.
No extensions or makeup opportunities will be available otherwise. Note that
excuses for connectivity issues within 30 minutes of an assignment deadline are
unlikely to be approved. Those situations can be prevented or mitigated with
planning and time management.


## Time Commitment

Auburn University has the following
[expectation](http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/student_policies/) of the time
commitment and work that a course will require per credit hour. "*Auburn
University expects that for each credit hour awarded, an appropriately prepared
student will complete an average of 3-3.5 hours of academic work per week over
the length of a 15 week semester.*" This time estimate is independent of
instructional mode. 

This course carries two credit hours, so at a minimum, an "appropriately
prepared" student would be expected to
spend 6 hours each week working on this course. Regardless of the specifics,
you are expected to allocate an appropriate amount of time for this course. 


## Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is critical to the entire educational process and is a
serious matter in this course. You are expected to apply the 
[Auburn University Oath of Honor](https://wp.auburn.edu/sga/initatives/academic-affairs/oath-of-honor/)
to each graded item in this course:

> In accordance with those virtues of Honesty and Truthfulness set forth in the
> Auburn Creed, I, as a student and fellow member of the Auburn family, do
> hereby pledge that all work is my own, achieved through personal merit and
> without any unauthorized aid. In the promotion of integrity, and for the
> betterment of Auburn, I give honor to this, my oath and obligation.

Issues surrounding violations of academic honesty will be handled per the 
[Student Academic Honesty Code](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/policies/academichonestycode.pdf). 
You are encouraged to familiarize yourself with this policy and the other 
resources available from the 
[Office of Academic Effectiveness](http://www.auburn.edu/academic/provost/academic-effectiveness/academic-honesty.php).

What constitutes cheating on exams and tests is fairly obvious, and everyone
understands that anything other than individual work on these is wrong. Where
many students are unsure of what is allowable and what is not allowable is in
the completion of programming assignments. I encourage students to form study
groups, help each other learn the course material, and help each other solve
problems. Collaborative problem solving is a great way to learn. However,
collaborative problem solving must be restricted to the level of concepts,
strategies, and algorithms; it should never involve source code. If you're in
doubt about a certain practice, it's best to ask rather than assume it's okay.
In certain instances, course work may be completed in groups rather than
individually, but these instances will be clearly identified by the instructor
and the collaboration is allowed only within the bounds set by the instructor.


## Communication with Instructor and Teaching Assistants

Your Auburn University email address (`@auburn.edu`) is the university-approved
form of communication between instructors and students. Emails that you send to
the instructor or to a teaching assistant must come from your `@auburn.edu`
email address. Sending emails from addresses other than `@auburn.edu` could
result in you not receiving a response to your message. Do not send messages via
Canvas; instead, send an email.

All course announcements will be posted to Canvas and/or sent to your
`@auburn.edu` address. All email communications from the instructor to you
will be sent to your `@auburn.edu` address. Follow the steps in the video
linked
[here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Video-Guide/Notification-Preferences-All-Users/ta-p/383690)
to set your notifications preferences and specify that all course alerts are
routed to your `@auburn.edu` email address. You are expected to check both
Canvas and your `@auburn.edu` account daily. 


## Getting Help in the Course

If you find yourself struggling academically in this course, please reach out to
your instructor and/or a teaching assistant as soon as possible. Do not wait
until the end of the term to seek help for problems that were present weeks
earlier. The instructor and teaching assistants want to help you, but can not do
so unless you ask in a timely manner.


## Accessibility

Students who need accommodations are asked to electronically submit their
approved accommodations through AU Access and to arrange a meeting with me
during the first week of classes, or as soon as possible if accommodations are
immediately needed. If you need accommodations but have not established them,
make an appointment with the Office of Accessibility, 1228 Haley Center,
334-844-2096.


## Diversity and Inclusion Statement

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be
well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in
and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be
viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present
materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, religion,
sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, veteran status, ethnicity,
race, and culture. All students in this course are expected to respect their
fellow classmates and actively participate in fostering an inclusive learning
environment. If you experience anything in this class that makes you feel
uncomfortable, please bring it to my attention and we will formulate a
response. If you would prefer to remain anonymous you may complete a 
[Bias Incident Report](http://studentaffairs.auburn.edu/bert/submit-a-report-of-bias/) 
which will maintain your confidentiality.

Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other
students or student groups.


## Classroom Behavior

The Auburn University 
[Policy on Classroom Behavior](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/PolicyonClassroomBehavior.pdf)
is strictly followed in this course. Note that this policy extends to all
online elements of this course including Zoom, Honorlock, Vocareum, Piazza,
and all electronic communication.


## Grade Appeals

Scores for all graded items will be posted to Canvas. You will have five
business days from the date that a score is posted to Canvas to send an email
to the instructor requesting grade adjustments on your work. If no appeal is
sent to the instructor after five business days, the score is final. Once the
five-day appeal period has passed, students forfeit their right to have the
graded material reassessed at a later date.

To appeal a grade that you have received, send an email to the instructor
specifying the graded item in question and justifying in a clear, concise
manner why you think your response should be awarded more points. Once
received, the instructor may or may not communicate with you regarding your
appeal. Ultimately, the instructor will render a decision. 


## Extended Student Absence

If illness causes you to be unable to participate in the course, please
contact me as soon as possible to discuss your options.


## Extended Instructor Absence

If illness causes me to be unable to continue teaching the course, a back-up
instructor has been selected who will assume all teaching responsibilities to
ensure that the course will proceed uninterrupted.


## Auburn University Transition to Remote Operations

If Auburn University is forced to move to remote operations, the instructional
modality for this course will be Online Synchronous. No changes to course
content or schedule would be anticipated, but all such details will be announced
via Canvas and updated in this syllabus as appropriate. You should personally
plan now for this contingency to ensure that you will be able to minimize the
disruption this move could cause to your personal living and study arrangements.


## Data Collection and Use Disclosure

Any and all results of graded items in the course are data sources for
research and assessment, and may be used in publications related to research
and accreditation. All such use will be anonymous.
