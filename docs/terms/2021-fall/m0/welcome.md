# Welcome to COMP 1200!

This the first course in computing and programming for most engineering
majors, as well as some majors in other STEM disciplines. COMP 1200 is
designed to introduce computational and algorithmic thinking applied in the
context of problem solving and computer programming, discuss the role and
importance of computing and programming in engineering disciplines, provide
opportunities for students to apply engineering processes to convert raw data
into meaningful information, and provide a foundation in programming for
engineering problem solving.

## Course Outcomes

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Formulate solutions to common engineering problems from specifications, real-world data representation, and real-world problem examples.
- Convert raw data into meaningful output and accurate results.
- Create solutions to simple engineering problems and express those solutions using an appropriate programming language.
- Appreciate the central roles that computing and programming play in engineering.
