# Getting Started With ProctorU

This course uses the [ProctorU](https://www.proctoru.com/portal/auburn) proctoring system for
exams. All fees associated with using ProctorU except late scheduling premiums are being paid by the College of Engineering
 this term, so there is no software to purchase or licensing fee for
you to pay. You ​do not need to create an account or schedule an appointment
in advance. 

## Requirements

The following things are required for you to use ProctorU.

- A laptop or desktop computer.
- A working webcam (integrated or external USB device).
- [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) with the [ProctorU extension installed](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proctoru/goobgennebinldhonaajgafidboenlkl) or [Firefox browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) with the [ProctorU extension installed](https://www.proctoru.com/firefox).

For detailed information on ProctorU please read the 
[minimum system requirements](https://www.proctoru.com/live-plus-resource-center) and the information provided
[for students](https://support.proctoru.com/hc/en-us/categories/115001818507).


## Taking an Exam or Test

Before you are able to take the exam, you must [schedule your exam](https://support.proctoru.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011622247-How-do-I-schedule-my-exam-)
at least 72 hours in advance. You may incur [late scheduling premiums](https://support.proctoru.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028406332-What-are-Premium-Fees-and-Premium-Scheduling-Rescheduling-)
 if you attempt to schedule an exam in less than 72 hours advance. 

When you are ready to take an exam or test, log into Canvas, go to your
course, and click on your exam or test. Clicking ​**Launch Proctoring**​ will
begin the PrctorU authentication process, where you will take a picture of
yourself, show your ID, and complete a scan of your room. ProctorU will be
recording your exam session by webcam as well as recording your screen.
ProctorU also has an integrity algorithm that can detect search-engine use,
so please do not attempt to search for answers, even if it's on a secondary
device.

ProctorU support is available 24/7/365. If you encounter any issues, you may
contact ProctorU by live chat from your ProctorU account and/or phone (​1-855-772-8678​).


## Best Practices

Here are recommended best-practices for taking exams with ProctorU.

- Create a [different profile in Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824) for taking exams instead of using your normal browsing/work profile.
- Install the ProctorU extension prior to each exam and uninstall it after each exam is over.
- Select a location and time that will help ensure your environment is as quiet and distraction-free as possible to take your exam.
- Ensure you have a stable network connection with sufficient bandwidth before starting your exam.
- Use your Auburn University [Tiger Card](http://www.auburn.edu/administration/tigercard/index.html) as your official photo ID as required by ProctorU. Only if you don't have your Tiger Card with your photo on it will you need to use a government-issued ID such as a driver's license, passport, or military ID.
