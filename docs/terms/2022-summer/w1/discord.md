# Getting Started With Discord

This course uses the [Discord](https://discord.com/) as an optional communication platform.
Discord is an efficient way for you to ask a question and have it answered.
Particularly for a large class, the average time between a question being
asked and it being answered is far shorter than had the question been asked in
an email to the course instructional staff.

To get started, use the link above to join Discord (free). Then use this invitation link [https://discord.gg/uZEbK2SDdp](https://discord.gg/uZEbK2SDdp)
to join the course server through Discord web, desktop, and/or mobile app.

While not mandatory, it would be best if you used your real name so I can identify you and look up your work on Canvas quickly.
Also, while you are allowed to be casual, you are required to adhere to the [classroom behavior policy.](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/PolicyonClassroomBehavior.pdf)
