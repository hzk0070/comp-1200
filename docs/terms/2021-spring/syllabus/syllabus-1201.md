# COMP 1201 Introduction to Computing Laboratory <br> Spring 2021 Course Syllabus - MATLAB Sections

*This syllabus is subject to change. Substantive changes will be announced in Canvas.*

*Published: January 10, 2021; Updated: February 7, 2021*

---

# Instructional Mode

Auburn University sent the following communication to all faculty on December 29, 2020:

> The spring semester will proceed as scheduled. In an effort to gradually increase campus density, faculty offering face-to-face classes may choose to begin the semester remotely for up to two weeks. Faculty will communicate any changes to their students.

To aid the gradual return to campus, this course will be taught remotely from January 11 through January 24, and will transition to the originally-published modality on January 25, 2021. More information is given below.

## January 11 Through February 7

The instructional mode for this course will be
[*Online Synchronous*](http://auburn.edu/academic/provost/AU_Spring21_Modalities.pdf). 
During the first two weeks, course will be conducted online in its entirety,
and you will not have to be on campus for any part of this course. There will
be optional synchronous online course activities in which you are
encouraged to participate remotely during the scheduled class time.
The details of this are as follows.

- *Lab meetings*: Your Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) will hold a live Zoom session during your scheduled lab time. Registration for COMP 1201 is optional and participation in the associated live Zoom sessions are also optional.

You are expected to have all the equipment and software needed to be
successful in this course. At a minimum, you must have a computer with a
webcam and microphone, and a broadband Internet connection capable of
installing and reliably running both
[Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-requirements-for-Windows-macOS-and-Linux)
and [Honorlock](https://honorlock.com/support/). You must also be able to
install and reliably run the software specific to this course as described
later in this syllabus. If you have needs regarding instructional technology,
you should contact the AU Bookstore at `books@auburn.edu`.

Times for all course events (assignment deadlines, exam times, etc.) will be set in US [Central Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/ct). You are responsible for meeting deadlines in Central Time regardless of what your local time zone may be. You may find it helpful to follow the instructions linked [here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-set-a-time-zone-in-my-user-account-as-a-student/ta-p/414) to have Canvas show deadlines appropriately in your local time zone to avoid any confusion.

## February 7 Through End-Of-Term

The instructional mode for this course will be 
[*Face-to-Face Required*](http://auburn.edu/academic/provost/AU_Spring21_Modalities.pdf). 
In brief, this means that at least half of the contact hours for this course
will involve in-person activities; you will be expected to attend all such
activities and required to attend some. The details of this are as follows.

- *Lab meetings*: Your Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) will hold an in-person lab meeting during your scheduled lab time. A maximum attendance of 50% room capacity will be strictly enforced, and a student roation schedule will be used, if necessary, to ensure an appropriate room occupancy is maintained.
Registration for COMP 1201 is optional, but attendance will be required for the enrolled students.


### In-Person Lecture Attendance and Room Occupancy Policy

Safe practices recommended by [AU](http://auburn.edu/covid-resource-center/policies/safe-practices/) and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) will be observed during all in-person class meetings. In particular:

- **Students are required to wear masks.** Each student will be required to wear a mask at all times during in-person class meetings. Students not wearing a mask will be asked to put one on. Any student not complying with the request to wear a mask will be asked to leave the classroom and the instructor will notify Student Affairs. If a student does not wear a mask and does not leave the classroom, the instructor will cancel the class immediately.

- **The instructor will wear a mask.** In light of CDC information on [airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-sars-cov-2.html) the instructor will wear a mask during lecture to mitigate the risk to students attending class.

- **A Healthcheck green pass screen is required.** All students must show their [Healthcheck](https://ahealthieru.auburn.edu/) green pass screen for the given day of attendance. The instructor will show his green pass screen for each lecture day.

- **Room occupancy limits with six-foot distancing will be observed.** In accordance with the [AU Facilities Classroom Capacity Analysis](http://www.auburn.edu/administration/facilities/Covid-19/classroom-sheets/index.html),
the [maximum seating occupancy for Shelby 2205](http://www.auburn.edu/administration/facilities/Covid-19/classroom-sheets/ShelbyCenterForEngineeringTechnology/Shelby%20Center%20for%20Engineering%20Technology%202205.pdf) is 29, and
the [maximum seating occupancy for Shelby 2210](http://www.auburn.edu/administration/facilities/Covid-19/classroom-sheets/ShelbyCenterForEngineeringTechnology/Shelby%20Center%20for%20Engineering%20Technology%202210.pdf) is 20.
Most labs will be able to accommodate all enrolled students, and therefore attendance is expected at every lab session.
In case where lab has admitted students up to its seating occupancy limit, later arriving students will be redirected to another lab.

# Course Policies


## Attendance

You are expected to attend all class meetings and stay for the entire period. You are responsible for all
material presented in class meetings whether you are present or not. It is your responsibility to collect
any graded materials that were returned during your absence. If you are excessively late to an exam,
the instructor reserves the right to count you absent from the exam and give you the opportunity to
take a make-up.


## Time Commitment

Auburn University has the following
[expectation](http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/student_policies/) of the
time commitment and  work that a course will require per credit hour. "*Auburn
University expects that for each credit hour awarded, an appropriately
prepared student will complete an average of 3-3.5 hours of academic work per
week over the length of a 15 week semester.*" This time estimate is
independent of instructional mode, so although this course is being offered
Online Synchronous, you should plan on spending the same amount of
preparation, work, and “in class” time on this course as you would if you
were taking the course face-to-face. 

This course carries one credit hour, so at a minimum, you should expect to
spend 3 hours each week working on this course. Regardless of the specifics,
you are expected to allocate an appropriate amount of time for this course. 

## Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is critical to the entire educational process and is a
serious matter in this course. You are expected to apply the 
[Auburn University Oath of Honor](https://wp.auburn.edu/sga/initatives/academic-affairs/oath-of-honor/)
to each graded item in this course:

> In accordance with those virtues of Honesty and Truthfulness set forth in the
> Auburn Creed, I, as a student and fellow member of the Auburn family, do
> hereby pledge that all work is my own, achieved through personal merit and
> without any unauthorized aid. In the promotion of integrity, and for the
> betterment of Auburn, I give honor to this, my oath and obligation.

Issues surrounding violations of academic honesty will be handled per the 
[Student Academic Honesty Code](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/policies/academichonestycode.pdf). 
You are encouraged to familiarize yourself with this policy and the other 
resources available from the 
[Office of Academic Effectiveness](http://www.auburn.edu/academic/provost/academic-effectiveness/academic-honesty.php).

What constitutes cheating on exams and tests is fairly obvious, and everyone
understands that anything other than individual work on these is wrong. Where
many students are unsure of what is allowable and what is not allowable is in
the completion of programming assignments. I encourage students to form study
groups, help each other learn the course material, and help each other solve
problems. Collaborative problem solving is a great way to learn. However,
collaborative problem solving must be restricted to the level of concepts,
strategies, and algorithms; it should never involve source code. If you're in
doubt about a certain practice, it's best to ask rather than assume it's okay.
In certain instances, course work is to be completed in groups rather than
individually, but these instances will be clearly identified by the instructor
and the collaboration is allowed only within the bounds set by the instructor.


## Communication with Instructor and Teaching Assistants

Your Auburn University email address (`@auburn.edu`) is the
university-approved form of communication between instructors and students.
Email is preferred to the Canvas messaging feature. Emails that you send to
the instructor or to a teaching assistant should come from your `@auburn.edu`
email address. Sending emails from addresses other than `@auburn.edu` could
result in you not receiving a response to your message.

All course announcements will be posted to Canvas and/or sent to your
`@auburn.edu` address. All email communications from the instructor to you
will be sent to your `@auburn.edu` address. Follow the steps in the video
linked
[here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Video-Guide/Notification-Preferences-All-Users/ta-p/383690)
to set your notifications preferences and specify that all course alerts are
routed to your `@auburn.edu` email address. You are expected to check both
Canvas and your `@auburn.edu` account daily. 

## Getting Help in the Course

If you find yourself struggling academically in this course, please reach out to your instructor and/or a teaching assistant as soon as possible. Do not wait until the end of the semester to seek help for problems that were present weeks earlier. The instructor and teaching assistants want to help you, but can not do so unless you ask in a timely manner.

## Accessibility

Students who need accommodations are asked to electronically submit their
approved accommodations through AU Access and to arrange a meeting with me
during the first week of classes, or as soon as possible if accommodations are
immediately needed. If you need accommodations but have not established them,
make an appointment with the Office of Accessibility, 1228 Haley Center,
334-844-2096.

## Diversity and Inclusion Statement

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be
well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in
and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be
viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present
materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, religion,
sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, veteran status, ethnicity,
race, and culture. All students in this course are expected to respect their
fellow classmates and actively participate in fostering an inclusive learning
environment. If you experience anything in this class that makes you feel
uncomfortable, please bring it to my attention and we will formulate a
response. If you would prefer to remain anonymous you may complete a 
[Bias Incident Report](http://studentaffairs.auburn.edu/bert/submit-a-report-of-bias/) 
which will maintain your confidentiality.

Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other
students or student groups.

## Classroom Behavior

The Auburn University 
[Policy on Classroom Behavior](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/PolicyonClassroomBehavior.pdf)
is strictly followed in this course. Note that this policy extends to all
virtual elements of this course including Zoom, Honorlock, Vocareum, Piazza,
and all electronic communication.

## Late Assignment Submission

Assignments and activites are participation-based and are not graded. They will not have due dates.

## Exam and Test Makeup

This course does not have an exam or test.


## Extended Student Absence

If illness causes you to be unable to participate in the course, please
contact me as soon as possible to discuss your options.

## Extended Instructor Absence

If illness causes me to be unable to continue teaching the course, a back-up
instructor has been selected who will assume all teaching responsibilities to
ensure that the course will proceed uninterrupted.

## Data Collection and Use Disclosure

Any and all results of graded items in the course are data sources for
research and assessment, and may be used in publications related to research
and accreditation. All such use will be anonymous.

# Course Policies


## Attendance

The 
[AU Policy on Class Attendance](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/PolicyonClassAttendance.pdf) 
is strictly observed in this course. Refer to the Instructional Mode section of
this syllabus for a description of all course elements that require attendance.
Absences are considered unexcused unless the student specifically obtains an
excused absence from the instructor (see policy below).

Note that *attendance* is only one part of *engagement*. You are expected to
fully engage in this course and take responsibility for your learning
experience. Lack of engagement almost always leads to poor course performance.


## Excused Absences

To have an absence excused you must first obtain an Excused Absence Memo from
Engineering Student Services (ESS), as described below.

> Engineering Student Services provides excused absence memos to students who
> present verifiable documentation related to university excused absences.  The
> steps for obtaining an excused absence memo are as follows:
>
> 1. The student submits the request form using this link: [https://aub.ie/EngAbsence](https://aub.ie/EngAbsence)
>    - Students submit documentation of the reason for the absence.
>    - Students must read and acknowledge the excused absence policy.
>
> 1. The ESS office staff processes the requests and verifies authenticity of documentation provided by student, as well as the dates of the absence(s).
>
> 1. Assistant Dean determines if the documentation meets the standard for a university excused absence or if the documentation warrants consideration by the professor.
>
> 1. An official memo is sent directly to professors via email regarding the student’s absence
>
> NOTE: The ESS office does not process excused absences for red screens from the
> GuideSafe app. Students receive a notification email related to the “greater
> risk” red screen instructing them not to come to campus.  Students can provide
> this email as documentation for Covid-related absences. 


## Exam and Test Makeup

This lab does not have an exam or test.


## Late Assignment Submission

Assignments and activites are participation-based and are not graded. They will not have due dates.


## Connectivity Issues

If connectivity issues (e.g., Internet connection problems, electrical power
failures) prevent you from completing an element of the course on time, you must
notify the instructor immediately when the incident occurs (email to
`dh@auburn.edu` and/or voicemail to 334-844-6305) and then provide appropriate
documentation (e.g., service provider notices) within one hour of the incident.
No extensions or makeup opportunities will be available otherwise. Note that
excuses for connectivity issues within 30 minutes of an assignment deadline are
unlikely to be approved. Those situations can be prevented or mitigated with
planning and time management.


## Time Commitment

Auburn University has the following
[expectation](http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/student_policies/) of the time
commitment and work that a course will require per credit hour. "*Auburn
University expects that for each credit hour awarded, an appropriately prepared
student will complete an average of 3-3.5 hours of academic work per week over
the length of a 15 week semester.*" This time estimate is independent of
instructional mode. 

This course carries one credit hours, so at a minimum, an "appropriately
prepared" student would be expected to
spend 3 hours each week working on this course. Regardless of the specifics,
you are expected to allocate an appropriate amount of time for this course. 


## Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is critical to the entire educational process and is a

is strictly followed in this course. Note that this policy extends to all
online elements of this course including Zoom, Honorlock, Vocareum, Piazza,
and all electronic communication.


## Grade Appeals

Scores for all graded items will be posted to Canvas. You will have five
business days from the date that a score is posted to Canvas to send an email
to the instructor requesting grade adjustments on your work. If no appeal is
sent to the instructor after five business days, the score is final. Once the
five-day appeal period has passed, students forfeit their right to have the
graded material reassessed at a later date.

To appeal a grade that you have received, send an email to the instructor
specifying the graded item in question and justifying in a clear, concise
manner why you think your response should be awarded more points. Once
received, the instructor may or may not communicate with you regarding your
appeal. Ultimately, the instructor will render a decision. 


## Extended Student Absence

If illness causes you to be unable to participate in the course, please
contact me as soon as possible to discuss your options.


## Extended Instructor Absence

If illness causes me to be unable to continue teaching the course, a back-up
instructor has been selected who will assume all teaching responsibilities to
ensure that the course will proceed uninterrupted.


## Auburn University Transition to Remote Operations

If Auburn University is forced to move to remote operations, the instructional
modality for this course will be Online Synchronous. No changes to course
content or schedule would be anticipated, but all such details will be announced
via Canvas and updated in this syllabus as appropriate. You should personally
plan now for this contingency to ensure that you will be able to minimize the
disruption this move could cause to your personal living and study arrangements.


## Data Collection and Use Disclosure

Any and all results of graded items in the course are data sources for
research and assessment, and may be used in publications related to research
and accreditation. All such use will be anonymous.
