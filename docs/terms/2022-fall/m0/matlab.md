# Getting Started With MATLAB

This course will use the
[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) programming
environment from [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/). MATLAB is widely
used in engineering practice [worldwide](https://uk.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/handout/2020-company-factsheet-8-5x11-8282v20.pdf), 
and it is a common first language for engineering students in colleges and
universities.

MATLAB is available as a standalone application, as a web-accessible service
in the cloud, and as a component integrated into other applications such as
Canvas and even your course zyBook. You will likely have an opportunity to use
MATLAB in each of these ways this semester, but we will start off by simply
accessing it directly from your zyBook. Later in the course we will provide
instructions on how to install the standalone application and access the
online version in the cloud. But for now, all you have to do is interact
through the zyBook.
