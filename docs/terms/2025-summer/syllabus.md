# Instructional Mode

The instructional mode for this course is *Online Asynchronous*. The course
will be conducted online in its entirety, and there will be no specific time
of day during which you are required to participate in a course activity. You
will be responsible for setting your own schedule for completing course
readings, watching pre-recorded lecture videos, submitting assignments and
taking exams no later than the published deadlines, and completing all other
activities required by this course.

You are expected to have all the equipment and software needed to be
successful in this course. At a minimum, you must have a computer, a
broadband Internet connection capable of interacting with Canvas and zyBooks
via a web browser, as well as streaming video and audio of pre-recorded
lectures, and a webcam to record your exam session.

Times for all course events (assignment deadlines, exam times, etc.) will be
set in US [Central Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/ct). 
You are responsible for meeting deadlines in Central Time regardless of
what your local time zone may be. You may find it helpful to follow the
instructions linked
[here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-set-a-time-zone-in-my-user-account-as-a-student/ta-p/414)

# Grading

Your grade for the course will be determined by the points you earn on items
in the following categories.

- **Exams** (30%): There will be four exams in the course, including the Final Exam. The worst exam grade will be dropped, thus causing the Final Exam to act as a universal makeup exam.
This means that students happy with their grade at the end of the semester can skip taking the comprehensive final exam, but it also means that taking the final exam can only improve your grade, never lower it.
Dates for each will be set and announced at least one week in advance.

- **Programming Tests** (30%): There will be four programming-based tests in the course, including the Final Programming Test.
The worst programming test grade will be dropped, thus causing the Final Programming Test to act as a universal makeup test.
This means that students happy with their grade at the end of the semester can skip taking the final programming test, but it also means that taking the final programming test can only improve your grade, never lower it.
Dates for each will be set and announced at least one week in advance.
*Programming Test grades will be based on the percentage of test cases passed. Passing zero test cases will result in a grade of zero points.*

- **zyBook Activities** (40%): There will be a series of Participation Activities and Challenge Activities throughout the assigned chapters of the course zyBook. 
You will complete these activities directly in the zyBook and submit them to earn points for your work.
All assignments are due at the end of their respective module, but you may "catch-up" any work until the last day of the semester for full credit.



*Total*   | Letter Grade
--------  | ------------
90% or above    | A
80% to <90%     | B
70% to <80%     | C
60% to <70%     | D
below 60%       | F

**Extra Credit:** Opportunities for extra credit are sometimes given to the
entire class, but are never given on an individual basis.

# Course Policies


## Attendance

The 
[AU Policy on Class Attendance](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/PolicyonClassAttendance.pdf) 
is strictly observed in this course. Refer to the Instructional Mode section of
this syllabus for a description of all course elements that require attendance.
Absences are considered unexcused unless the student specifically obtains an
excused absence from the instructor (see policy below).

Note that *attendance* is only one part of *engagement*. You are expected to
fully engage in this course and take responsibility for your learning
experience. Lack of engagement almost always leads to poor course performance.


## Excused Absences

To have an absence excused you must first obtain an Excused Absence
Memo from Engineering Student Services (ESS) for any absence that falls into
categories 1 through 6 in the AU Policy on Class Attendance. You should contact
the course instructor directly for other absences.

> Engineering Student Services provides excused absence memos to students who
> present verifiable documentation related to university excused absences.  The
> steps for obtaining an excused absence memo are as follows:
>
> 1. The student submits the request form using this link: [https://aub.ie/EngAbsence](https://aub.ie/EngAbsence)
>    - Students submit documentation of the reason for the absence.
>    - Students must read and acknowledge the excused absence policy.
>
> 1. The ESS office staff processes the requests and verifies authenticity of documentation provided by student, as well as the dates of the absence(s).
>
> 1. Assistant Dean determines if the documentation meets the standard for a university excused absence or if the documentation warrants consideration by the professor.
>
> 1. An official memo is sent directly to professors via email regarding the student’s absence


## Exam and Test Makeup

A missed exam or test can only be made up for excused absences (see policy).
Students must contact the instructor **within 48 hours** from the time that the
exam or test was given or the exam or test score will remain zero.

In lieu of individual make up exam/test, the grade earned on the final exam/test will
substitute all excused missed midterm grade.


## Late Assignment Submission

All assignments are due on the date and time specified in Canvas,
but late submissions are accepted until the last day of the semester before the finals week
for full credit without the need for an Excused Absence Memo. No further extension
will be given on the late submission deadline. 


## Connectivity Issues

If connectivity issues (e.g., Internet connection problems, electrical power
failures) prevent you from completing an element of the course on time, you must
notify the instructor immediately when the incident occurs (email to
`hzk0070@auburn.edu`) and then provide appropriate
documentation (e.g., service provider notices) within one hour of the incident.
No extensions or makeup opportunities will be available otherwise. Note that
excuses for connectivity issues within 30 minutes of an assignment deadline are
unlikely to be approved. Those situations can be prevented or mitigated with
planning and time management.


## Time Commitment

Auburn University has the following
[expectation](http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/student_policies/) of the time
commitment and work that a course will require per credit hour. "*Auburn
University expects that for each credit hour awarded, an appropriately prepared
student will complete an average of 3-3.5 hours of academic work per week over
the length of a 15 week semester.*" This time estimate is independent of
instructional mode. 

This course carries two credit hours, so at a minimum, an "appropriately
prepared" student would be expected to
spend 6 hours each week working on this course. Regardless of the specifics,
you are expected to allocate an appropriate amount of time for this course. 


## Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is critical to the entire educational process and is a
serious matter in this course. You are expected to apply the 
[Auburn University Oath of Honor](https://wp.auburn.edu/sga/initatives/academic-affairs/oath-of-honor/)
to each graded item in this course:

> In accordance with those virtues of Honesty and Truthfulness set forth in the
> Auburn Creed, I, as a student and fellow member of the Auburn family, do
> hereby pledge that all work is my own, achieved through personal merit and
> without any unauthorized aid. In the promotion of integrity, and for the
> betterment of Auburn, I give honor to this, my oath and obligation.

Issues surrounding violations of academic honesty will be handled per the 
[Student Academic Honesty Code](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/policies/academichonestycode.pdf). 
You are encouraged to familiarize yourself with this policy and the other 
resources available from the 
[Office of Academic Effectiveness](http://www.auburn.edu/academic/provost/academic-effectiveness/academic-honesty.php).

What constitutes cheating on exams and tests is fairly obvious, and everyone
understands that anything other than individual work on these is wrong. Where
many students are unsure of what is allowable and what is not allowable is in
the completion of programming assignments. I encourage students to form study
groups, help each other learn the course material, and help each other solve
problems. Collaborative problem solving is a great way to learn. However,
collaborative problem solving must be restricted to the level of concepts,
strategies, and algorithms; it should never involve source code. If you're in
doubt about a certain practice, it's best to ask rather than assume it's okay.
In certain instances, course work may be completed in groups rather than
individually, but these instances will be clearly identified by the instructor
and the collaboration is allowed only within the bounds set by the instructor.

## AI Policy

In this course, students are permitted to use Generative AI Tools like ChatGPT 
for assignments and to assist in studying, but **not** on exam. To maintain academic integrity, students must disclose 
any AI-generated material they use and properly attribute it, including in-text 
citations, quotations, and references. Students should exercise caution and 
avoid sharing any sensitive or private information when using these tools. Examples 
of such information include personally identifiable information (PII), protected 
health information (PHI), financial data, intellectual property (IP), and any 
other data that might be legally protected.

A student should include the following statement in assignments to indicate use of
 a Generative AI Tool: “The author(s) would like to acknowledge the use of [Generative AI Tool Name],
 a language model developed by [Generative AI Tool Provider], in the preparation of this assignment. 
 The [Generative AI Tool Name] was used in the following way(s) in this assignment 
 [e.g., brainstorming, grammatical correction, citation, which portion of the assignment].”


## Communication with Instructor and Teaching Assistants

Your Auburn University email address (`@auburn.edu`) is the university-approved
form of communication between instructors and students. Emails that you send to
the instructor or to a teaching assistant must come from your `@auburn.edu`
email address. Sending emails from addresses other than `@auburn.edu` could
result in you not receiving a response to your message. Do not send messages via
Canvas; instead, send an email.

All course announcements will be posted to Canvas and/or sent to your
`@auburn.edu` address. All email communications from the instructor to you
will be sent to your `@auburn.edu` address. Follow the steps in the video
linked
[here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Video-Guide/Notification-Preferences-All-Users/ta-p/383690)
to set your notifications preferences and specify that all course alerts are
routed to your `@auburn.edu` email address. You are expected to check both
Canvas and your `@auburn.edu` account daily. 


## Getting Help in the Course

If you find yourself struggling academically in this course, please reach out to
your instructor and/or a teaching assistant as soon as possible. Do not wait
until the end of the term to seek help for problems that were present weeks
earlier. The instructor and teaching assistants want to help you, but can not do
so unless you ask in a timely manner.


## Accessibility

Students who need accommodations are asked to electronically submit their
approved accommodations through AU Access and to arrange a meeting with me
during the first week of classes, or as soon as possible if accommodations are
immediately needed. If you need accommodations but have not established them,
make an appointment with the Office of Accessibility, 1228 Haley Center,
334-844-2096.


## Classroom Behavior

The Auburn University 
[Policy on Classroom Behavior](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/PolicyonClassroomBehavior.pdf)
is strictly followed in this course. Note that this policy extends to all
online elements of this course including Zoom, Honorlock, Vocareum, Piazza,
and all electronic communication.


## Grade Appeals

Scores for all graded items will be posted to Canvas. You will have five
business days from the date that a score is posted to Canvas to send an email
to the instructor requesting grade adjustments on your work. If no appeal is
sent to the instructor after five business days, the score is final. Once the
five-day appeal period has passed, students forfeit their right to have the
graded material reassessed at a later date.

To appeal a grade that you have received, send an email to the instructor
specifying the graded item in question and justifying in a clear, concise
manner why you think your response should be awarded more points. Once
received, the instructor may or may not communicate with you regarding your
appeal. Ultimately, the instructor will render a decision. 


## Extended Student Absence

If illness causes you to be unable to participate in the course, please
contact the insctructor as soon as possible to discuss your options.


## Extended Instructor Absence

If illness causes the insctructor to be unable to continue teaching the course, a back-up
instructor has been selected who will assume all teaching responsibilities to
ensure that the course will proceed uninterrupted.


## Auburn University Transition to Remote Operations

If Auburn University is forced to move to remote operations, the instructional
modality for this course will be Online Synchronous. No changes to course
content or schedule would be anticipated, but all such details will be announced
via Canvas and updated in this syllabus as appropriate. You should personally
plan now for this contingency to ensure that you will be able to minimize the
disruption this move could cause to your personal living and study arrangements.


## Data Collection and Use Disclosure

Any and all results of graded items in the course are data sources for
research and assessment, and may be used in publications related to research
and accreditation. All such use will be anonymous.

## Use of content
All materials provided as part of this course, whether online or in person, are 
copyright protected and intended to be used solely for this course.  Further use 
or distribution to persons not involved in this course is an infringement of 
university policy.
