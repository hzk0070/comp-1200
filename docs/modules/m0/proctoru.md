## Best Practices

Here are recommended best-practices for taking exams with ProctorU.

- Select a location and time that will help ensure your environment is as quiet and distraction-free as possible to take your exam.
- Ensure you have a stable network connection with sufficient bandwidth before starting your exam.
- Use your Auburn University [Tiger Card](http://www.auburn.edu/administration/tigercard/index.html) as your official photo ID as required by ProctorU. Only if you don't have your Tiger Card with your photo on it will you need to use a government-issued ID such as a driver's license, passport, or military ID.


## Taking a Practice Quiz
